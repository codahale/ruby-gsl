Building and installing ruby-gsl is pretty straight-forward:

$ tar -zxf ruby-gsl-0.2.0.tar.gz
$ cd ruby-gsl-0.2.0/ext
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make

To install:

$ make install

or

$ make site-install

To run one of the samples:

$ ruby samples/special.rb

If you want to run the samples without installing the library first:

$ ruby -Iext -Icontrib samples/special.rb

To check if everything is working properly, do

$ for i in *.rb; do ruby -I../ext -I../contrib $i > /dev/null; done

in the samples directory. Except for error.rb there should be no errors.

Notes:
If you have installed GSL in a place where it is not easily found
by the installation scripts, try using "--with-gsl-include=<dir>"
and "--with-gsl-lib=<dir>" as arguments to extconf.rb

To use ruby-gsl you need a complete installation of GSL (i.e. library
and header files, in some Linux distributions this is separated).

Notes for Cygwin users:
The GSL library that comes with Cygwin is missing some functions. Therefore
these functions will not be included in ruby-gsl. If you have a GSL
installation built from source (and you know what you're doing), you can 
comment out the Cygwin check in extconf.rb
